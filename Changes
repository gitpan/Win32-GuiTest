Revision history for Perl extension Win32::GuiTest.

0.01  Wed Aug 12 21:58:13 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.02  Sun Oct 25 20:18:17 1998
	- Added several Win32 API functions (typemap courtesy of 
	  Win32::APIRegistry):
		SetForegroundWindow
		GetDesktopWindow 
		GetWindow 
		GetWindowText 
		GetClassName 
		GetParent
		GetWindowLong
		SetFocus
	- Ported FindWindowLike (MS-KB, Article ID: Q147659) from VB to
	  Perl. Instead of using "like", I used Perl regexps. Why
	  didn't Jeffrey Friedl include VB in "Mastering Regular
	  Expressions"? ;-)

    - Perhaps first version released thru CPAN (user: erngui).
    - Changed name from Win32::Test to Win32::GuiTest
    - Fixed bug: using strdup resulted in using system malloc and 
      perl's free, resulting in a runtime error.  
      This way we always use perl's malloc. Got the idea from
      'ext\Dynaloader\dl_aix.xs:calloc'.
